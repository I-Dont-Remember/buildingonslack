ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This site is maintained by [Kevin Quinn](https://kevinquinn.fun). It's a collection of my notes & thoughts on the Slack ecosystem as I continue expanding the types of projects and interactions I have within it.

## What is this site for?

- Using Slack better while building a company/organization.
- Developing amazing Slack Apps, both internal and publicly available.
- Becoming a power user of all of Slack's awesome features.
- Understanding how SaaS founders in the past were able to build businesses on top of Slack.


## Who are you?

I'm a software engineer who has used Slack at organizations ranging in size from 2 people to thousands. I've been a part of building Slack apps at each of those organizations, and I just really enjoy learning & teaching about Slack. I'm also [Slack Certified](/docs/slack/slack-certified/) if that matters to you.
