Slack made a move into education when they released their [Slack Certified site](https://www.slackcertified.com/).
They offer two certifications (Slack Certified Admin, Slack Certified Developer) as well as variety of [Slack Skills](https://www.slackcertified.com/page/slack-skills) you can complete in just a couple hours and show off your new badge.

## How much does Slack certification cost?

You'll want to get these expense0d by a company, I wouldn't recommend an individual forking out the money for these certifications.

- Slack Certified Admin | Test **$150** + (optional) Prep Course **$150** = up to **$300**
- Slack Certified Developer | Test **$150** + (optional) Prep Course **$150** = up to **$300**

## How long is my certification valid for?

> "Certifications are valid for 24 months from the date that you became certified" - [faq](https://www.slackcertified.com/page/frequently-asked-questions#Earn)

## How to find Slack Certified members?

Slack created a directory of people who have obtained their certifications - my profile for example is [Kevin Quinn | Slack Certified Directory](https://directory.slackcertified.com/profile/222b79883b7b2eae76ac467931ddbb14553725d9?name=kevin%20quinn).
