When you're considering building an app nowadays, you're flooded with choices. You can build a stand-alone application, or build on top of a thousand different platforms that already have a growing market share. After building on Slack for several years, there's a few lessons that have stuck out.

- Pro & Con: Slack: restrict you to use their blocks design system, just a bunch of JSON - as a backend engineer who hates moving buttons around on the frontend, absolutely essential. but their's also plenty of times where you want an input type that doesn't exist, or to add a confirmation to a modal submission, or etc and you just can't.
- i think it's overall a benefit because it's flexible enough you're almost never blocked from doing something, sometimes you just have to get a little creative. but you save so much time because you never have to worry about fiddling with how things look - it's always exactly like the blocks you expect. You get to focus on the UX of your app, not where a button is.

- Your growth is limited by the platform's growth
