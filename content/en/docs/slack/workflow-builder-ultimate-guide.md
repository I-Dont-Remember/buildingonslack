- Early 2023 should see the launch of `if-then` logic to Workflows, according to multiple press releases from _Sept 2022_ - [Technzine.eu](https://www.techzine.eu/news/devops/87761/slack-expands-workflow-builder-with-if-then-statements/), [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/01/slack-gains-new-automation-features-including-conditional-logic-for-workflows/).
-  _"Also early next year, Slack will expand its library of Workflow Builder steps with tasks like automatically creating channels and alerting users once they start a workflow and providing integrations for additional third-party apps and tools."_

Fun fact! Workflow Builder was originally a [Slack app called Missions](https://www.robotsandpencils.com/work/high-tech/missions/), which was then acquired by Slack in 2018 and built into what you know today.
