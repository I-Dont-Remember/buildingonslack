The web is filled with design inspo for web apps - but what about **Slack Apps**? We want to build good user interfaces, too! We began collecting examples of useful Slack App experiences & designs as a resource below. This is a community effort to hopefully raise the bar for Slack Apps, both publicly available and internal to companies.

## Public vs Internal Apps

Even internal Slack Apps deserve to have good UX. PLus, there are MANY times more internal apps than public.

Today, youâ€™ll find 2,450 apps ready for install."
