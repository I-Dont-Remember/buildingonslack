The web is filled with design inspo for web apps - but what about **Slack Apps**? We want to build good user interfaces, too! We began collecting examples of useful Slack App experiences & designs as a resource below. This is a community effort to hopefully raise the bar for Slack Apps, both publicly available and internal to companies.
